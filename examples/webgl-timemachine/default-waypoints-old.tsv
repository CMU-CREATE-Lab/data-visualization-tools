Mozambique	Mozambique	Most of African land change is due to smallholder agriculture, where families clear woodlands and forest to grow crops. The sustainability of such systems given burgeoning populations is threatened as they require fallow periods for land to recover before subsequent clearing. The threats to biodiversity are great as humans encroach on the remaining natural woodland and forest ecosystems.	#v=-16.15889,37.395,5.77,latLng&t=2.10&l=bdrk,fly
Indonesia	Indonesia	Industrial scale clearing of tropical forests to produce palm oil and wood products is clear in Riau, Sumatra, Indonesia. Palm oil is found in many household products and foods and is produced only in the humid tropics. Humid tropical forests are the most biodiverse on the planet and their replacement by monoculture palm estates and tree plantations results in ecosystem collapse.	#v=0.63876,101.5635,6.77,latLng&t=2.10&l=bdrk,fly
Paraguay	Paraguay	Paraguay is the site of one of the highest deforestation rates globally, from its Interior Atlantic Forests in the east to Chaco woodlands in the west. Land is cleared for row crops or pastures, with little area set aside for nature or indigenous reserves.	#v=-22.28684,-60.587,5.77,latLng&t=2.10&l=bdrk,fly
Cote Dâ€™Ivoire	Cote D'Ivoire	Forest loss within protected areas in Cote D'Ivoire is evident and related to the two civil wars of 2002 and 2007 and a resulting breakdown in governance. The dynamic points out the fragility of protected area networks which on paper can cover a substantial area of a given country, but are subject to exploitation in times of conflict.	#v=6.11351,-5.9305,6.77,latLng&t=2.10&l=bdrk,fly
Kalimantan	Kalimantan	Like Sumatra, Kalimantan, Indonesia is the site of large-scale agroindustrial clearing. Kalimantan's peatlands, habitat for orangutans and extensive carbon stores in peatland soils, are increasingly appropriated for palm oil production. The interior highlands are logged, but not cleared as extensively as accessible lowland and wetland forests.	#v=-2.33696,111.769,6.77,latLng&t=2.10&l=bdrk,fly
Sarawak	Sarawak	The border of Malaysia and Indonesia on the island of Borneo reveals a variation in forest exploitation between the two countries. Interior Borneo is the site of intensive high-grading of high value tropical forests on the Malaysian side of the border. The Heart of Borneo conservation initiative will likely rely on the Indonesian side of the border for conserving the unique ecosystem services of montane Borneo forests.	#v=2.24524,114.679,7.77,latLng&t=2.10&l=bdrk,fly
Russia/Finland	Russia/Finland	Under Soviet rule, a buffer of forest was maintained along the Russian-Finland border. Recent access to this forest under Russian governance has led to increased forest clearing. The Finland side of the border reflects a long-held smallholder forestry land use, and a lack of intact natural forests.	#v=61.57181,28.766,5.77,latLng&t=2.10&l=bdrk,flg
