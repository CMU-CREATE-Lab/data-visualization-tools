Columbia Glacier			Columbia Glacier	The Columbia Glacier is located in the Prince William Sound on the south coast of Alaska.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=glaciers&waypoints=1heCve9RLJVh8GYRQxL4QTdS9i9uVID0I5g25c2rnOtw&v=61.07595,-147.06482,9.31,latLng&t=0.00&ps=50&l=blsat&rebuild=1&story=default&bt=19840101&et=20161231																				
Accelerated Melting				Over the past 30 years, it has retreated more than 20 km (12.5 mi) to the north and lost about half of its thickness and volume, partially due to rising temperatures, making it one of the fastest changing glaciers in the world.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=glaciers&waypoints=1heCve9RLJVh8GYRQxL4QTdS9i9uVID0I5g25c2rnOtw&v=61.07595,-147.06482,9.31,latLng&t=0.00&ps=50&l=blsat&rebuild=1&story=default&bt=19840101&et=20161231																				
Columbia Retreat				While changes to the glacier have affected the global sea level rise, its thinning and retreat are not exclusively due to climate change. Other natural processes are also to blame for its changing state. It is likely that once the Columbia reaches the shoreline, its retreat will slow.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=glaciers&waypoints=1heCve9RLJVh8GYRQxL4QTdS9i9uVID0I5g25c2rnOtw&v=61.07595,-147.06482,9.31,latLng&t=0.88&ps=50&l=blsat																				
Mendenhall Glacier			Mendenhall Glacier 	The Mendenhall Glacier is located 21 km (13 mi) from Juneau, Alaska (US). As a popular tourist attraction, the glacier is 805 meters (half a mile) wide and up to 550 meters (1,800 feet) deep. It terminates into the Mendenhall lake, which was created in the 1930's from the glacier's melting ice.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=glaciers&waypoints=1heCve9RLJVh8GYRQxL4QTdS9i9uVID0I5g25c2rnOtw&v=58.44021,-134.56395,10.41,latLng&t=3.15&ps=50&l=blsat&bt=19840101&et=20161231																				
Iceland				Iceland's Breidamerkurjökull, part of the largest ice cap in Europe, has receded by 2 km (1.2 mi) since 1973. Breidamerkurjökull is an outlet glacier, so as icebergs break away, they drift slowly to the mouth of the Jökulsárlón lagoon and eventually join the ocean.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&story=default&v=64.12444,-16.36689,9.415,latLng&t=3.24&ps=50&l=blsat&bt=19840101&et=20161231																				
Mount Kilimanjaro 				The Furtwangler glacier tops Mount Kilimanjaro and is the highest point in Africa. In 1912, the ice cap covered 11.4 sq km (4.4 sq mi). By 2011 this had been reduced by 85% to 1.76 sq km (0.68 sq mi). Most of this glacial loss is attributed to warmer global temperature.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&story=default&v=-3.06742,37.35563,10,latLng&t=0.03&ps=50&l=blsat&bt=19840101&et=20161231&reboot=1																				
Pine Island Glacier				Pine Island Glacier is one of the largest ice streams in Antarctica. It flows into the Amundsen Sea embayment in West Antarctica.  The glacier’s rapid thinning and receding contribute directly to sea level rise.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&story=default&v=-74.88242,-102.13624,5.285,latLng&t=1.14&ps=50&l=blsat&bt=19840101&et=20161231&rebuild=1&rebuild=1

##Urban Fragility	https://earthtime.org/stories/Urban_Fragility	https://earthtime.org/m/stories/Urban_Fragility	Urban Fragility	Exploring Threats to Our Cities Using Data	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=17.59725,9.08731,0,latLng&t=0.00&startDwell=0&endDwell=0ps=50&l=bdrk,uf&bt=20000101&et=20151231			Story by: Robert Muggah <br> Data from: Igarapé Institute, UMD, UCDP, Google																	
City Lights				Cities are the anchors of human civilization. By 2050, an estimated three quarters of humanity will live in one. While offering opportunities for prosperity, cities of tomorrow will also confront monumental challenges associated with poverty, inequality and fragility. Red areas represent increased lights at night.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=37.92784,-3.36529,0.173,latLng&t=1.93&startDwell=0&endDwell=0ps&l=blsat,lan&bt=20000101&et=20151231&ps=50																				
Urban Fragility				This data represents every city in the world with a population of 250,000 or more. Some are more fragile than others, as represented by the larger, darker circles. 	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=17.59725,9.08731,0,latLng&t=0.00&ps=50&l=bdrk,uf&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Regional Fragility				Fragility occurs when the city’s social contract starts to unravel. It is due to a disequilibrium of expectations between the public authorities and citizens.  Notice the changes in fragility over time and region.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=17.59725,9.08731,0,latLng&t=0.00&ps=50&l=bdrk,uf&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Importance				Fragile cities are a risk not just to their residents, but also to entire countries and regions.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=17.59725,9.08731,0,latLng&t=0.00&ps=50&l=bdrk,uf&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Africa & Asia				Especially in those parts of the world where urbanization is proceeding at breakneck speed, as in Africa and Asia. Here, cities are urbanizing before they industrialize, which can quickly overwhelm their abilities to deliver services.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=3.23065,28.79281,2,latLng&t=0.88&ps=50&l=bdrk,uf&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Multiple Stresses				Fragility cannot be readily boiled down to a single risk factor, such as murder rates, lack of potable water, or pollution. Rather, fragility is more of a convergence of multiple stresses. As these risks accumulate, they undermine a city’s social contract and in extreme cases can push it to the brink of collapse. 	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=17.59725,9.08731,0,latLng&t=0.00&ps=50&l=bdrk,uf&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Fragility Changes				Notice how fragility changes over time as small blue circles (not very fragile) turn to big red circles (very fragile).	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=30.89875,49.21945,1,latLng&t=1.54&ps=50&l=bdrk,uf&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Unaffordable Cities				Cities are continuing to segregate according to race, income and social mobility. Even some of our most successful cities, while booming, are becoming unaffordable to the majority of people.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=13.18571,-53.04656,1,latLng&t=1.54&ps=50&l=bdrk,uf&bt=20000101&et=20151231

Syria Displacement			Displacement in Syria	Prior to the 2011 start of civil war in Syria, instability grows in the region, represented by larger, darker circles. Since 2011, 5 million refugees have fled Syria, and there are another 6.5 million who are internally displaced.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=fragile_cities&story=default&waypoints=1vLYX7BUqZQaC3AAxy6oLwhHhiFWO62OtZvG9s0OGXt4&v=34.27786,41.7299,4.66,latLng&t=0.00&ps=50&l=bdrk,uf&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Sea Level Rise			Sea Level Rise 	With two-thirds of the world's cities on the coasts, sea level rises will generate devastation and flight.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=fragile_cities&story=default&waypoints=1vLYX7BUqZQaC3AAxy6oLwhHhiFWO62OtZvG9s0OGXt4&v=21.55169,99.68215,3.03,latLng&t=0.00&ps=50&l=blsat,slr4&bt=0&et=0.83																				
Deforestation 			Deforestation 	Cities are also at least partly responsible for devastating climate change. They are engines of consumption, including meat and agricultural products from the rural hinterlands. Massive forests - including the world's largest terrestrial carbon sinks - are being razed to make way for cattle and soy.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=-11.30881,-58.97132,3.672,latLng&t=1.66&ps=50&l=blsat,aflg&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Amazon Rainforest			Deforestation 	The Amazon, for example, is disappearing (forest loss in red). This affects carbon capture and also upsets delicate cloud and rain patterns. This in turn can undermine water availability of cities, as we are seeing around the world.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=-11.30881,-58.97132,3.672,latLng&t=1.66&ps=50&l=blsat,aflg&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Fires at Night			Carbon 	This data represents fires at night visible from space. Cities produce immense amounts of carbon. About 75% of all carbon emissions are from cities even though they cover less than 3% of the world's surface area and are home to 54% of the worlds population. Carbon is released by fires, flares, vehicle emissions, cement production and so much more.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=37.06973,6.57916,0,latLng&t=22.12&ps=100&l=bdrk,viirs&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Solutions			Solutions	The good news is that decision makers are waking up to the risks of city fragility. And not a moment too soon: A broad understanding of urban risk is critical to developing appropriate solutions. There is growing investment not just in developing smarter cities, but also ones that are more resilient to multiple threats.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=19.6071,-1.41337,0,latLng&t=0.59&ps=50&l=bdrk,uf&bt=20000101&et=20151231																				
Singapore			Singapore	Having a long term plan is key. Cities need to develop a plan and implement it. Singapore laid out a 50 year plan in 1971 and renews that plan every five years. Many cities are too busy dealing with daily emergencies to plan the work and work the plan.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=city_growth&waypoints=1heCve9RLJVh8GYRQxL4QTdS9i9uVID0I5g25c2rnOtw&v=1.39029,103.8071,9.624,latLng&t=1.00&ps=50&l=blsat&story=default&bt=19840101&et=20161231																				
Seoul			Seoul	Adopting solutions that solve multiple problems. Seoul has transitioned from mostly automotive transportation to 75 percent of its citizens taking public transportation. The result is less emissions, less traffic congestion, and a population that doubled in the last three decades without a major expansion of its global footprint.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=city_growth&waypoints=1heCve9RLJVh8GYRQxL4QTdS9i9uVID0I5g25c2rnOtw&v=37.55925,126.96796,10.032,latLng&t=0.15&ps=50&l=blsat&story=default&bt=19840101&et=20161231																				
Medellin			Medellin	Strategies should be comprehensive and integrated. In Medellin, city authorities managed to drop the homicide rate from 381 per 100,000 in 1991 to about 16 per 100,000 today. This involved targeted community policing, municipal infrastructure improvements, better public transportation, and integrated public spaces such as “library parks” that combined green areas, community centers, and learning facilities.  Notice how the circles representing fragility get smaller over time.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=city_growth&waypoints=1heCve9RLJVh8GYRQxL4QTdS9i9uVID0I5g25c2rnOtw&v=6.25304,-75.56457,10,latLng&t=1.59&ps=50&l=blsat,uf&story=default&bt=19840101&et=20161231																				
Key Takeaway				What is the key takeaway? It takes many factors to render a city fragile, and overcoming fragility requires reimagining the urban landscape and accounting for all of those risks, not just a single one.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=default&story=default&waypoints=1ObAomZ0Y6t5-ztD6wVibyA1fVC09scfQIzj033R28vw&v=37.92784,-3.36529,0.173,latLng&t=1.93&startDwell=0&endDwell=0ps&l=blsat,lan&bt=20000101&et=20151231&ps=50

##Global Refugee Crisis A System Overburdened	https://earthtime.org/stories/Global_Refugee_Crisis_A_System_Overburdened	https://earthtime.org/m/stories/Global_Refugee_Crisis_A_System_Overburdened	Global Refugee Crisis: A System Overburdened	This story focuses on how international refugee systems are overburdened and cannot accomodate the record high numbers of people in the modern refugee crisis.	https://earthtime.org/explore#v=-12.92015,13.9148,0.339,latLng&t=0.045&ps=50&l=bdrk,ar&bt=20000431&et=20151231&startDwell=0&endDwell=0			Story by: Dr. Khalid Koser<br>Data from: UNHCR		TRUE															
Intro			Intro	The global refugee crisis is understood in the context of the movement of people, but it is also about a system overburdened.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&v=22.08143,12.68991,1.394,latLng&t=0.0&ps=50&bt=20090101&et=20120101&startDwell=0&endDwell=0&l=bdrk,ar&disableUI=true																				
Intro				Refugees are people fleeing conflict or persecution. They are defined and protected in international law, and must not be expelled or returned to situations where their life and freedom are at risk.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&v=22.08143,12.68991,1.394,latLng&t=0.0&ps=50&bt=20090101&et=20120101&startDwell=0&endDwell=0&l=bdrk,ar&disableUI=true																				
Intro				Countries and international organizations lack funding to accomodate the large numbers of refugees, leaving many refugees without basic resources.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&v=22.08143,12.68991,1.394,latLng&t=0.0&ps=50&bt=20090101&et=20120101&startDwell=0&endDwell=0&l=bdrk,ar&disableUI=true

Syria			Syria	Moving to Syria, civil war has displaced half of the population, either internally or across boarders.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&v=38.45686,33.65464,2.632,latLng&t=1.29&ps=50&bt=20110101&et=20131230&startDwell=0&endDwell=0&l=bdrk,ar																				
Syria				During this time, an unprecedented number of Syrian refugees flee to Europe in search of asylum.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&v=41.04718,22.12386,2.748,latLng&t=1.39&ps=50&bt=20110101&et=20131231&startDwell=0&endDwell=0&l=bdrk,ar																				
Syria				The majority of Syrian refugees move nearby, to Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&v=36.47484,36.4811,3.848,latLng&t=1.29&ps=50&bt=20110101&et=20131231&startDwell=0&endDwell=0&l=bdrk,ar																				
Syria				These relatively poor countries, already facing water and demographic challenges, are bearing the brunt of the Syrian refugee crisis. 	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&v=36.47484,36.4811,3.848,latLng&t=1.29&ps=50&bt=20110101&et=20131231&startDwell=0&endDwell=0&l=bdrk,ar																				
Syria				Great risks accompany refugees crossing the Mediterranean into Europe from Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, 4,000 people drowned in the Mediterranean trying to reach Europe for safety.	https://staging.earthtime.org/stories/refugee_crisis_2#v=26.78506,13.3589,1.556,latLng&t=1.52&ps=50&l=bdrk,ar&bt=20000101&et=20161231

Returnees			Returnees	In these areas, refugees have a far poorer chance of returning to their countries and often live in refugee camps for decades.	https://staging.earthtime.org/stories/refugee_crisis_2#v=20.01605,27.7413,2.122,latLng&t=1.23&ps=50&l=bdrk,ar&bt=20000101&et=20161231																				
Camps			Camps	When refugees live in camps for extended periods of time, they can become disenfranchised, marginalized and jobless. They may feel hopeless and angry. We need to find new and innovative solutions for refugee camps.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&v=10.83314,21.8354,1.54,latLng&t=1.56&ps=50&bt=20120101&et=20151231&startDwell=0&endDwell=0&l=bdrk,ar																				
Integration			Integration	We also need to focus downstream by integrating refugees into their new countries so they are hopeful, productive and part of the future we wish to build together.	https://earthtime.org/#theme=big_picture_on_nature&v=10.83314,21.8354,1.54,latLng&t=1.56&ps=50&bt=20120101&et=20151231&startDwell=0&endDwell=0&l=bdrk,ar
