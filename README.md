# Apps
Apps are available in the apps directory. To invoke an app, access an url like this:

    http://localhost/apps/visualvector/index.html#source=/data/bin/viirs-flaring-2013-12-10.bin

where /data/bin/viirs-flaring-2013-12-10.bin is an URL to the binary file to visualize. More information is available in the README.md inside each app directory.

# Libraries

External libraries are placed under 'js/libs'. All visualization and data loading code is packaged as RequireJS modules and are located under 'js/app'.

# Example data

Example data is available in the data branch of this repo. NOTE: Do not merge between the data branch and the master branch - they are entierly separate.
